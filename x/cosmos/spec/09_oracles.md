# Oracles
Oracles are responsible for communicating data on the cosmos chain to the persistence chain cosmos module.   

Oracles hold a private key shard to an address that is controlled by the persistence validator set.     
Oracles observe events emitted on the cosmos chain and make transactions on persistence chain.

# Liquid Staking

Liquid staking, as a concept, is a mechanism in which these delegations are made liquid and can be transformed, traded, or otherwise utilised. Often this is implemented as a set of smart contracts, whereby the user deposits tokens in the smart contract and some validators acting on behalf of the protocol are then delegated to by the smart contract itself.

The goal of liquid staking is to allow delegations to maintain their staked position while simultaneously permitting them to seek out the best returns for their capital. This is achieved by minting an asset representative of the native bonded token at the point of delegation, which can then in turn be used by DeFi protocols.

The expectation with the widespread adoption of liquid staking is that the bonded stake of a chain should converge upon some value near 100%, as the liquid version of the underlying token can be traded on markets in the lieu of the native asset. As such, the security of the underlying chain reaches its theoretical maximum while maintaining a liquid supply.
